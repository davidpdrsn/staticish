# Staticish

**NOTE:** Its currently still in development and is not ready for production use.

This is an experimental static-ish site generator.

My idea behind this project is that I would like a static site generator that also handles dynamic content in the form of JSON responses. My hope is to make something that is a easy to use as a static site generator but still supports features like searching and other dynamic things.
